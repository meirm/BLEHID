Use a single ESP32 touchscreen device to control any software with custom shortcuts and layout.

I wanted to work with Blender 3D on my 13" laptop. Blender 3D as many other professional softwares such as Krita and Gimp use a lot of keystrokes to run different commands. Some of them use the Numpad which many laptops have not.
While is possible to use an external numpad, you still need to memorize the keyboard shortcuts.
On top of that the numpad design is natural for entering numbers not the functionality used in these programs.

So, I used the "ESP32 Development Board - WT32-SC01 With 3.5In 320X480 Capacitive Multi-Touch LCD Screen Built-In Bluetooth Wifi"
